// isRetrySafe is the gate that decides whether a request may be transparently
// re-attempted. It is the property that duplicates a customer's resource when
// it breaks: a transient 5xx on a create is ambiguous — the request may already
// have been applied and only the response lost — so retrying an unkeyed POST
// mints a second session, a second fleet slot, and a second charge from one
// call the customer made once.
//
// retry_test.go covers withRetry: which ERRORS are retried. Nothing covered
// which REQUESTS may be retried at all, so this gate was untested in the Go SDK
// while the TypeScript and Python SDKs both exercise it. A divergence here would
// affect only Go users and nothing would have said so.
